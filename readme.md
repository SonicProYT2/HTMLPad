# What do these files do????/??!1!

## .pas and .fm files

These are **neccessary** to *any* Pascal application to even work, so if you're fetching unneccessary files, don't touch these!

## .ico

Basically, just an icon.

## .lpi, lpr, lps

These are *Lazarus project files*. If you don't use that, feel free to exclude them.

## .res

No matter on what IDE you are, these keep an icon, a manifest (yeah, I don't know what that thing means either lol), and some basic application info.
It's *not neccessary*, but *isn't unneccessary* either. That's your choice.

## lib folder

Just libraries. **OF COURSE** it's neccessary!

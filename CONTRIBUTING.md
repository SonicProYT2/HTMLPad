# [en] Contributing Guidlines.
It's easy enough, as long as you follow the rules.
## Committing 
Commit directly to master **only if you know what exactly are you doing**.  
It also applies to *other branches*, but not that much. If it is a quick fix, then go with it!
### Write an inforative name for your push and commits!
That's it. No I'm serious.
